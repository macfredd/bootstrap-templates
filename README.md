# Bootstrap Templates Repository

This repository contains various templates made with Bootstrap. The idea is to add templates as I progress in my practices and personal projects. This repository is intended to collect Bootstrap templates that can be useful for different projects and purposes. Each directory contains a different template, with its own set of files and resources needed for its operation.
